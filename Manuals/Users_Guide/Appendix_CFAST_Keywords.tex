\chapter{Structure of the CFAST Input File} \label{sec:CFAST_Keywords}



The purpose of this appendix is to describe the format of the text-based input file that is generated by the CEdit graphical user interface. A simple input file is listed below. The input values may be integers, real numbers, or text. The input file is a comma-separated ASCII text file and may be edited with a spreadsheet program or any text editor. It is possible to use a word processor but it is important to save the file in ASCII text format and not in a word processing format. Note that some word processors will save punctuation and other characters incorrectly for the simple ASCII text file used by CFAST. It is recommended that the input files be created with the input editor, CEdit, provided as part of the CFAST distribution.  In addition to checking the input data for errors, it includes typical ranges for input values to assist in appropriate use of the model.

Each line of the input file consists of a label followed by one or more alphanumeric parameters associated with that input label, separated by commas.  The label must always begin in the first space of the line and be in capital letters.  Following the label, the values may start in any column, and all values must be separated by a comma.  Values may contain decimal points if needed or desired.  They are not required.

Inputs are in standard SI units.  The maximum line length is 1024 characters, so all data for each keyword must fit in this number of characters.

\section{COMPA}

The COMPA keyword defines the size and location of all compartments in a simulation. The compartments are numbered internally as they are read in. The other key words which refer to compartment numbers then refer to these ordinals. Compartments must be defined before they are referenced by other commands.   The arguments are
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[NAME] Short description of the compartment.
  \item[WIDTH, DEPTH, HEIGHT] size of the compartment.
  \item[X0, Y0, Z0] location of the lower left/front corner of the compartment.
   \item[CEILING, FLOOR, WALL] compartment surface materials which must match a SHORT NAME for one of the defined material properties.
   \item[XGRID, YGRID, ZGRID] grid spacing for slice and isosurface files for the compartment. These may be different for each compartment.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
COMPA,hallway,9.1,5.0,4.6,0.,0.,0.,CONCRETE,CONCRETE,CONCRETE,50,50,50
\end{lstlisting}

\section{DEADROOM}

The DEADROOM keyword specifies a dead-end compartment, i.e., a compartment that is only connected to another compartment that in turn is not connected to the outside.  Compartment pressure is not calculated for the dead-end room. Pressure for this room is assumed to be the same as that of the connected room.
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number of the dead-end room.
  \item[CONNECTED] compartment number of the connected compartment.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
DEADROOM,2,1
\end{lstlisting}

\section{DETEC}

The DETEC keyword is used for both detectors and sprinklers. Sprinklers and detectors are both considered detection devices and are handled using the same input keywords.  Detection is based upon heat transfer to the detector. Fire suppression by a user-specified water spray begins once the associated detection device is activated. For the type of detector, use 1 for smoke detector and 2 for heat detector or sprinklers. If suppression is set to a value of 1, a sprinkler will quench the fire with the specified spray density of water. If turned off (a value of 0), the device is handled as a heat or smoke detector only - values entered for activation temperature, RTI, and spray density are ignored. The spray density is the amount of water dispersed by a water sprinkler.  The units for spray density are length/time.  These units are derived by dividing the volumetric rate of water flow by the area protected by the water spray. The suppression calculation is based upon an experimental correlation by Evans, and depends upon the RTI, activation temperature, and spray density to determine the behavior of the sprinkler.
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TYPE] detector type.
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number where the detector is located.
  \item[TRIGGER] activation value for the detector. For smoke detectors, this is obscuration; for heat detectors or sprinklers, this is temperature.
  \item[X, Y, Z] detector location relative to the lower, left, front corner of the compartment.
  \item[RTI] response time index (RTI) value for a sprinkler
  \item[SUPPRESSION] set to 1 if suppression is activated
  \item[SPRAY DENSITY] amount of water dispersed by the sprinkler
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
DETECT,2,1,344.2,1.5,1.5,2.29,98,1,7.00E-05
\end{lstlisting}

\section{DTCHE}

The purpose of the DTCHE keyword is to prevent excessive computation with a very small time step. This often appears to users as though the program has frozen, when it is simply the set of equations has reached a point that requires very small time steps for the solver to converge. A negative entry on DTCHE turns off the time step checking algorithm. A positive value for the minimum time input sets the software for a maximum number of iterations below a minimum time step before producing an error and stopping.
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TIME] minimum time step for equation solver.
  \item[COUNT] maximum number of iterations below minimum time step before program stops in error.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
DTCHECK,1.E-9,100
\end{lstlisting}

\section{EAMB}

This keyword sets ambient conditions for the outside of the building. Temperatures are in Kelvin and pressure in Pascals. Default values for temperature and pressure are 20~\degc, 101325~Pa, respectively.
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TEMPERATURE] ambient temperature outside the building.  This is a constant throughout a simulation.
  \item[PRESSURE] ambient pressure outside the building. This is a constant throughout a simulation.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
EAMB,300,101325
\end{lstlisting}

\section{EVENT}

EVENT is used to open or close a vent or to change filtering. This replaces the earlier CVENT and applies to all vents for vertical flow (V), horizontal flow (H) mechanical flow (M), and filtering of mechanical ventilation (F). Except for filtering, this has been replaced with inputs on the appropriate vent command or by the RAMP command beginning in CFAST version 7.1.2.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TYPE] Type indicates the vent type associated with this EVENT action. ``H'' indicates a horizontal flow event that changes the vent opening, ``V'' a vertical flow event, ``M'' a mechanical flow event, and ``F'' for filtering of mechanical ventilation flow.
  \item[FIRST] compartment number of lower numbered (for wall vents), top (for ceiling/floor vents) or from compartment (for mechanical vents).
  \item[SECOND] compartment number of higher numbered (for wall vents), bottom (for ceiling/floor vents) or to compartment (for mechanical vents).
  \item[ID] vent number associated with the vent consistent with appropriate vent command.
  \item[TIME] beginning time of vent opening or filter fraction change.
  \item[FRACTION] final vent opening fraction or filter fraction.
  \item[DECAY] time over which opening or filter transitions from its initial fraction to its final fraction.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
EVENT,H,1,2,1,10.,0.3,1
\end{lstlisting}

The convention for vent fractions is the 1 is 100 \% open, and 0 is closed. Filtering applies only to trace species and particulate (soot) and only to mechanical ventilation vents. For filtering, 0 indicates no filtering and 1 indicates that all soot and trace species flowing through the fan is removed.

\section{FIRE}

The FIRE keyword places a fire into a compartment. The associated keywords CHEMI, TIME, HRR, SOOT, CO, TRACE, AREA, and HEIGH completely specify time-dependent properties the fire for the current fire. They must be included, in order, directly after the associated FIRE keyword input line

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] the compartment in which the fire is located.
  \item[X, Y, Z] the width, depth, and height of the center of the base of the fire relative to the selected compartment.
  \item [PLUME] a ``1'' as the fifth argument is required to maintain compatibility with older versions of the model. It is ignored by the current of the model.
  \item[TYPE] fires can be initiated at a specific time, temperature or incident heat flux. Corresponding inputs are TIME, FLUX, or TEMP.  IF FLUX or TEMP is specified, an existing, user-specified target specified in the TARGET field is used to determine the ignition time.
  \item[CRITERION] is the initialing value for the current fire, either a time, temperature or incident heat flux as chosen above.
  \item[TARGET] user-specified target associated with this fire and used to judge ignition by temperature or incident heat flux.
  \item[0,0] zeros are required in the ninth and tenth arguments to maintain compatibility with older versions of the model.
  \item[NAME] user-specified name for the fire
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

  \item[T\_1, T\_2, T\_3, ... , T\_N-1, T\_N] time points
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsection{HRR}

The HRR input defines a series of heat release rates which correspond to entries on the TIME input.  These define the time-based variation of the fire size for the specified fire.

\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsection{HEIGH}

The HEIGH input defines a series of height values which correspond to entries on the TIME input.  These define the time-based variation of the vertical position of the base of the fire (measured from the floor of the current compartment) for the specified fire. The height used at any time point during a simulation is taken to be the sum of the height (Z) input in the FIRE keyword and the interpolated value of the HEIGH curve at the current time.

\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number of compartment assigned as a hall.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\section{HHEAT}

\begin{lstlisting}
HHEAT, FIRST_COMPARTMENT, NUMBER_OF_PARTS, N PAIRS OF {SECOND_COMPARTMENT, FRACTION}
\end{lstlisting}

Used to allow heat conduction between pairs of compartments which have a contiguous vertical partition between them.  There are two forms of this command. The first form is to use only a compartment number. In this case, CFAST will calculate the conductive heat transfer to all compartments connected to this compartment by wall vents. The second form specifies the compartments to be connected and what fraction of the compartment is connected to an adjacent compartment. This latter is particularly useful for rooms which are connected to adjacent rooms as well as hallways. The user of the model is responsible for the consistency of these pairings.  The model does not check to insure that the specified compartment pairs are physically located next to one another.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[FIRST] first compartment of pairs connected for horizontal heat transfer
  \item[N] number of compartments connected to first compartment
  \item[SECOND\_1, FRAC\_1, SECOND\_2, FRAC\_2, ... ,  SECOND\_N, FRAC\_N] N pairs of compartments and wall surface fraction of the first compartment connected to that compartment. Fractions should add to unity.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
HHEAT,1,1,2,0.5
\end{lstlisting}
specifies that compartment one has one connection to compartment two and the fraction of wall surface through which heat is transferred is one half of the wall surface of compartment one. The rest of compartment one is assumed connected to exterior ambient conditions.

\section{HVENT}

The HVENT keyword specifies a vent which allows horizontal flow of gases through wall vents such as doors and windows.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}

  \item[TYPE] vent openings can change at a specific time, temperature or incident heat flux. Corresponding inputs are TIME, FLUX, or TEMP.  IF FLUX or TEMP is specified, an existing, user-specified target specified in the TARGET field is used to determine the ignition time.
  \item[CRITERION] is the initialing value for the current vent, either a time, temperature or incident heat flux as chosen above.
  \item[TARGET] user-specified target associated with this vent and used to judge vent opening or closing based on temperature or incident heat flux.
  \item[INITIALTIME] for time-based vent opening change, the time that the change in vent opening begins. For times less than or equal to this time, the vent is open at the specified INITIALFRACTION.
  \item[INITIALFRACTION] fraction from 0 to 1 that vent is open up to the time specified in INITIALTIME
  \item[FINALTIME] for time-based vent opening change, the time that the change in vent opening ends. For times greater than or equal to this time, the vent is open at the specified FINALFRACTION.
  \item[FINALFRACTION] fraction from 0 to 1 that vent is open beginning at the time specified in FINALTIME
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
HVENT,1,2,1,1,2,0,2.5,0,1,TIME,,,0,1,0,1
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ISOF}

The ISOF command creates 3-dimensional animated contours of gas temperature in one or more compartments.  For example, a 300 \degc temperature isosurface is a 3-D surface on which the gas temperature is 300 \degc. The output frequency of the slice files is controlled by the SMOKEVIEW\_OUTPUT\_INTERVAL input on the TIMES input line. Note that 3-D isosurface files can be quite large if the output interval is small. Computational time can also increase significantly with specification of isosurface files.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[VALUE] gas temperature to be displayed as an isosurface
  \item[COMP\_1, COMP\_2, ... , COMP\_N] one or more compartment numbers. If no compartment number is included, all compartments in the simulation are assumed.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
ISOF, 300, 1, 2
ISOF, 600
\end{lstlisting}

The first example specifies a 300 \degc temperature isosurface in compartments 1 and 2.  The last example specifies 600 \degc isosurfaces in all compartments.

\section{LIMO2}

This parameter is global and applies to all fires. The keyword sets the lower oxygen limit for combustion. See the technical reference manual for the meaning and implication of modifying this parameter. \cite{CFAST_Tech_Guide_7}.

MATL,GLASSFB3,0.036,795,105,0.013,0.9,"Glass Fiber, Organic Bonded (1/2 in)"
\end{lstlisting}

\section{MVENT}

This replaces the more complex mechanical ventilation commands with a constant flow fan connection.  The original commands MVOPN MVFAN MVDCT and INELV are not supported in this version. The command specifies a pair of openings connected by a constant volume flow fan.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[FIRST] first compartment of pairs connected by a wall vent. First compartment must be a lower number than second compartment. Outside is indicated by the number of compartments plus one.

  \item[AREA] cross-sectional area of the vent connection in the first compartment.
  \item[ORIENTATION2] orientation of the diffuser grill for the vent in the second compartment. Vents may horizontal (H) or vertical (V). This effects the partitioning of flow between the layers in the compartment and the mechanical vent.

  \item[AREA2] cross-sectional area of the vent connection in the second compartment.
  \item[FLOW] fan flowrate from first compartment to second compartment.

  \item[PUPPER] At pressures greater than or equal to PUPPER, flow is zero. Between PLOWER and PUPPER, flow transitions from full flow to zero flow.
  \item[TYPE] vent openings can change at a specific time, temperature or incident heat flux. Corresponding inputs are TIME, FLUX, or TEMP.  IF FLUX or TEMP is specified, an existing, user-specified target specified in the TARGET field is used to determine the ignition time.

\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
MVENT,2,4,2,V,2.75,0.25,V,2.75,0.25,0.02,200,300,TIME,,,0,1,0,1,5,4
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ONEZ}

For tall compartments or those removed from the room of fire origin, the compartment may be modeled as a single, well-mixed zone rather than the default two-zone assumption. A single zone approximation is appropriate for smoke flow far from a fire source where the two-zone layer stratification is less pronounced than in compartments near the fire. This is used in situations where the stratification does not occur. Examples are elevators, shafts, complex stairwells, and compartments far from the fire. More than one compartment may be specified by including multiple ONEZ keywords.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number to be modeled as a single well-mixed zone.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
ONEZ,2
\end{lstlisting}

\section{RAMP}

The RAMP keyword specifies a time-varying opening for a wall, ceiling/floor, or mechanical vent.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TYPE] Type indicates the vent type associated with this RAMP. ``H'' indicates a horizontal flow event that changes the vent opening, ``V'' a vertical flow event, and ``M'' a mechanical flow event.
  \item[FIRST] compartment number of lower numbered (for wall vents), top (for ceiling/floor vents) or from compartment (for mechanical vents).
  \item[SECOND] compartment number of higher numbered (for wall vents), bottom (for ceiling/floor vents) or to compartment (for mechanical vents).
  \item[ID] vent number associated with the vent consistent with appropriate vent command.
  \item[N] number of compartments connected to first compartment
  \item[TIME\_1, FRAC\_1, TIME\_2, FRAC\_2, ... ,  TIME\_N, FRAC\_N] N pairs of time and opening fraction of the first compartment connected to that compartment. Fractions must be between 0 and 1.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
RAMP,V,3,2,1,3,0,0,100,0.5,500,1
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ROOMA and ROOMH}

These key words allow the user to define non-rectangular rooms by specifying cross-sectional area as a function of height. One set of values is included for each compartment that has a variable cross-sectional area. The format in both cases is the key followed by an index of the number of values. These key words must be used in pairs.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number to be modeled with variable cross-sectional area.
  \item[NUMBER] number of area or height inputs.
  \item[AREA\_1, AREA\_2, ... , AREA\_N] horizontal cross-sectional area at heights specified by the corresponding ROOMH keyword.
  \item[HEIGHT\_1, HEIGHT\_2, ... , HEIGHT\_N] height of corresponding horizontal cross-sectional specified by the corresponding ROOMA keyword.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
ROOMA 1    3     10.0  5.0  3.0
ROOMH 1    3     0.0   1.0  2.0
\end{lstlisting}

The example specifies that compartment 1 has a cross-sectional area of 10 m$^2$, 5 m$^2$ and 3 m$^2$ at elevations 0.0 m, 1.0 m and 2.0 m respectively.

\section{SLCF}

With Smokeview, CFAST can display animations of various gas phase quantities in a plane or volume in one or more compartments, depending on the inputs. For 2-D slices, the DOMAIN input is 2-D, followed by the selected plane (either X, Y, or Z), and a position within the compartment along the respective axis. For 3-D slices, the DOMAIN input 3-D is selected. One, several, or all compartments can be specified. As many SLCF commands as needed can be used in a CFAST input file.  The output frequency of the slice files is controlled by the SMOKEVIEW\_OUTPUT\_INTERVAL input on the TIMES input line. Note that 3-D slice files can be quite large if the output interval is small. Computational time can also increase significantly with specification of detailed 3-D slice files.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[DOMAIN] either 2-D for a single slice of temperature data or 3-D for all three dimensions.
  \item[PLANE] for 2-D slices, either X, Y, or Z specifying a slice perpendicular to the chosen plane.
  \item[POSITION] distance along the selected axis relative to the compartment origin.
  \item[COMP\_1, COMP\_2, ... , COMP\_N] one or more compartment numbers. If no compartment number is included, all compartments in the simulation are assumed.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
SLCF, 3-D, 1, 2, 3
SLCF, 2-D, X, 2.5, 3, 5
SLCF, 3-D
SLCF, 2-D
\\end{lstlisting}

The first SLCF example specifies a 3-D slice file output for compartments 1, 2, and 3.  The second SLCF example specifies a 2-d slice file output parallel to the X (depth) axis, 2.5 m from the axis origin in compartments 3 and 5. The last two examples specify default 3-D and 2-D slice file output for all compartments.

\section{STPMAX}

This specifies the largest time step that the model will take. The default value is one second. In most cases, the numerical routines adjust the time step appropriately; however, for long simulation times and slowly varying conditions, a larger value is appropriate. In cases where the fire height and vent soffits interact, the time step may need to be smaller.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[STEP] maximum time step.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
STPMAX,0.2
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ TAMB}

This keyword sets ambient conditions for the inside of the building. For the internal ambient, relative humidity sets the initial water concentration in the ambient air.  Temperatures are in Kelvin, pressure in Pascals, and relative humidity in percent. Default values for temperature, pressure, and relative humidity are 20~\degc, 101325~Pa, and 50~\%, respectively.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TEMPERATURE] ambient temperature. Default is 20 \degc.
  \item[PRESSURE] ambient pressure. Default is 101325 Pa.
  \item[RH] ambient relative humidity. Default value is 50 %.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
TAMB,300,101300,50
\end{lstlisting}

\section{TARGE}

CFAST can track and report calculations of the net heat flux striking arbitrarily positioned and oriented targets and the temperature of these targets. 

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[COMPARTMENT] compartment number where the detector is located.
  \item[X,Y,Z] location relative to the lower, left, front corner of the compartment.
  \item[NORMALX, NORMALY, NORMALZ] normal vector from front surface of target.
  \item[MATERIAL] material which must match a SHORT NAME for one of the defined material properties.
  \item[METHOD] must be EXPLICIT.
  \item[EQUATIONTYPE] PDE for cartesian coordinates or CYL for cylindrical coordinates.
  \item[INTERNALLOCATION] fraction of depth into material at which internal temperature is reported. For center of material, a value of 0.5 is specified.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
TARGET,1,2.2,1.88,2.34,0,0,1,CONCRETE,EXPLICIT,PDE,0.5,Targ 1
\end{lstlisting}

\section{TIMES}

Printed output will be on the screen or in a file named project.out. Five spreadsheet files are produced (project\_n.csv, project\_w.csv, project\_f.csv, and project\_s.csv, and project\_m.csv). 

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[SIMULATION] total simulation time.
  \item[PRINT] time interval for printed output.
  \item[SPREADSHEET] time interval for spreadsheet output.
  \item[SMOKEVIEW] time interval for smokeview output.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

TIMES,360,120,130,140,150,
\end{lstlisting}

\section{VERSN}

\begin{lstlisting}
VERSN,version number, Title
\end{lstlisting}

This input must be the first line in a CFAST input and largely specifies a title for the simulation. 

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[VERSION] version of the model for this input file.  Should be 7 for the current version.
  \item[TITLE] short descriptive title for the simulation
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{lstlisting}
VERSN,6,"Simple test of the object file input"
\end{lstlisting}

\section{VHEAT}

\begin{lstlisting}
VHEAT, FIRST_COMPARTMENT, SECOND_COMPARTMENT
\end{lstlisting}

Heat transfer between the ceiling and floor of specified compartments can be incorporated with the VHEAT key word. Ceiling to floor heat transfer occurs between interior compartments of the structure or between an interior compartment and the outdoors. The model checks to make sure that the ceiling and floor are reasonably contiguous (within 0.01 m), and the assumption is made that this is true for the entire ceiling and floor.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
\begin{description}
  \item[TOP] compartment number of top compartment connected for ceiling/floor heat transfer.
  \item[BOTTOM] compartment number of bottom compartment connected for ceiling/floor heat transfer.
\end{description}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
VHEAT,1,2
\end{lstlisting}

The floor properties of the top compartment (1 in this case) and the ceiling properties of the bottom compartment (2 in this case) must be defined by COMPA and included in the thermophysical file.

\section{VVENT}

This key word describes horizontal openings between compartments connected with a vent in the floor/ceiling between the compartments. Each VVENT line in the input file describes one floor/ceiling vent.

  \item[area] cross-sectional area of the vent.
  \item[SHAPE] numerical input specifies either a circular (1) or square (2) vent.
  \item[TYPE] vent openings can change at a specific time, temperature or incident heat flux. Corresponding inputs are TIME, FLUX, or TEMP.  IF FLUX or TEMP is specified, an existing, user-specified target specified in the TARGET field is used to determine the ignition time.
  \item[CRITERION] is the initialing value for the current vent, either a time, temperature or incident heat flux as chosen above.
  \item[TARGET] user-specified target associated with this vent and used to judge vent opening or closing based on temperature or incident heat flux.
  \item[INITIALTIME] for time-based vent opening change, the time that the change in vent opening begins. For times less than or equal to this time, the vent is open at the specified INITIALFRACTION.
  \item[INITIALFRACTION] fraction from 0 to 1 that vent is open up to the time specified in INITIALTIME
  \item[FINALTIME] for time-based vent opening change, the time that the change in vent opening ends. For times greater than or equal to this time, the vent is open at the specified FINALFRACTION.
  \item[FINALFRACTION] fraction from 0 to 1 that vent is open beginning at the time specified in FINALTIME

\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
VVENT,3,2,1,1,1,TIME,,,0,0,100,0.5,2.5,1
\end{lstlisting}



\chapter{Running CFAST from a Command Prompt}

The model CFAST can also be run from a Windows command prompt.  CFAST can be run from any folder, and refer to a data file in any other folder. The fires and thermophysical properties have to be in either the data folder, or the executable folder. The data folder is checked first and then the executable folder.

\begin{lstlisting}
[drive1:\][folder1\]cfast [drive2:\][folder2\]project
\end{lstlisting}

The project name will have extensions appended as needed (see below). For example, to run a test case when the CFAST executable is located in c:$\backslash$firemodels$\backslash$cfast7 and the input data file is located in c:$\backslash$data, the following command could be used:

\begin{lstlisting}
c:\firemodels\cfast7\cfast c:\data\testfire0   <<< note that the extension is optional.
\end{lstlisting}

Command line options

\begin{itemize}
\item -k - no interactive keyboard access
\item -i - initialization only
\item -c - compact output
\item -f - full output (c and f are exclusive). Note the interaction of the f and c option. The default for the console output is /c. The default for the file output is /f. This default action can be overwritten by explicitly including the /f or /c option.
\item -n - net heat flux option
\item -v - validation output (outputs a modified set of spreadsheet files with different column headers designed to facilitate automated analysis of the output)
\end{itemize}
