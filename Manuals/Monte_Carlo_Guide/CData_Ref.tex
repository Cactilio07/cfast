\chapter{Introduction}

The Monte Carlo method is "a broad class of computational algorithms that use repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results." with Stanislaw Ulam credited with inventing the modern version of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method working on nuclear weapons projects in the 1940s. In the 80’s and before research was on going to make use of Monte Carlo idea as a part of the move toward performance-based designs in fire safety engineering. Bukowski \cite{Bukowski_1985}, Clarke et al. \cite{Clarke_1990}, and more recently, building codes \cite{NFPA_5000} and engineering handbooks \cite{Hurley_2016} provide a structure for a fire hazard analysis that can be used to characterize the relative performance of two sets of fire scenarios. Bruns \cite{bruns_tn_2016} formalized the mathematics for applying the Monte Carlo method to fire hazard analysis as a means to further incorporate the method in regular preformance based designs. However, one of the limiting factors in a more widespread adoption of Monte Carlo analysis has been the large amount of data that needs to be generated and processed.

While at one time the issue was one of both computational power and tools designed to do the analysis that is not as true anymore. With the inexorable power of Moore’s Law, it is now relatively easy to obtain the computational power and storage to generate and analysis huge amounts of data. What is still largely lacking are the tools to make the process tenable. To that end the Fire Research Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology has been exploring the process \cite{NIST_TN_2041,Reneke_2017,Reneke_2018,Cleary_2019} in order to develop tools that will make Monte Carlo analysis a more widely used form of analysis. The result of this effort is the CFAST Fire Data Generator (CData).

\chapter{Defining the Question and the Analysis}

As briefly discussed in the introduction a significant amount of work has gone into understanding the basic requirements for a Monte Carlo analysis in a fire safety analysis [1,2]. They outline several key areas that need to be addressed in the analysis.  These include definition of:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Community / Building / Occupant characteristics
  \item Fire scenarios
  \item Analysis variables / Criteria for comparisons
  \item Statistical analysis of calculation results
\end{enumerate}

Community, building, and fire characteristics define the physical geometries of the model simulations (the range of building geometries, vents between compartments and the outside, and the range of fires to be studied). Occupant characteristics and criteria for comparisons define additional model inputs that may be necessary for analysis of calculation results (fire detection devices, the choice of additional model outputs to study tenability of egress paths, fire severity, or building structural integrity, for example). All of these may be defined by a single deterministic set of inputs (a single building geometry or desired fire for study), a collection of different, specific inputs (such as a set of specific building designs of interest), or a statistically-determined range of inputs (for example, defining compartment sizes or smoke detector activation from experimentally-determined distributions). This section details the process for defining a series of input files for analysis with examples for each major step in the process.

\section{Building Characteristics}

In CFAST, compartment geometry includes definition of the number of compartments, their size (length, width, and height), and their placement in relation to other compartments. In the study of a single structure, this is simply an enumeration of each compartment. Figure \ref{sample_visualization} shows the compartments in a single structure in a CFAST simulation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{FIGURES/Sample_Visualization.png}
\caption{Sample CFAST visualization of a single structure subject to a fire.}
\label{sample_visualization}
\end{figure}

Of course, if it is desired to study the impact of fires in a set of more than one specific building, the compartment geometry and placement could be defined by multiple individual buildings with the specific building chosen for an individual scenario chosen at random or from a distribution representing the population of each building type in the community under study.

The set of buildings for study can also be chosen from distributions of building and room characteristics. Figure \ref{sample_room_distribution} shows the distribution of the total floor area in a residence, the number of bedrooms in a residence depending on the total floor area, the total number of rooms given a certain number of bedrooms (here shown for residences from 1000~ft$^2$ to 1500~ft$^2$), all taken from the 2015 U.S. Housing Survey \cite{AHS2015}. Creating a compartment geometry from these data can be thought of as a six step process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item randomly select the total floor area of the structure, Fig. \ref{sample_room_distribution}(a);
    \item randomly select the total number of bedrooms for a structure of the size chosen in step 1, Fig. \ref{sample_room_distribution}(b);
    \item randomly select the total number of rooms in the structure of the chosen size and number of bedrooms (Fig. \ref{sample_room_distribution}(c) shows a sample distribution for homes ranging from 1000~ft$^2$ to 1500~ft$^2$. Distributions for other home sizes are available in ref. \cite{AHS2015});
    \item determine room sizes based on a distribution of bedroom sizes, allocating left over space to the other rooms;
    \item connect compartments as desired (for example by randomly setting vents as open or closed between compartment pairs); and
    \item ensure that the resulting structure is realizable (This random approach to generating connections has a probability of resulting in a floorplan that cannot be instantiated in a single story. More technically, if the floorplan is thought of as a graph with the rooms as vertices and the connections as edges, some of the randomly generated graphs will be nonplanar for cases with more than four rooms. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on a piece of paper and none of the edges cross. The probability of generating a nonplanar floorplan increases as the number of rooms increases. In order to eliminate such nonphysical cases from the analysis, any randomly generated floorplan can be checked for planarity and rejected if necessary and replaced by a new randomly generated floorplan).
\end{enumerate}

Other characteristics of the structure such as materials of construction, vent openings, fire definitions, measurement targets, sprinklers, and detection devices can be varied as desired for the problem being studied. Table \ref{tbl:distributable_variables} shows variables in the modeling that can be varied based on user-defined distributions \footnote{The content of this table follows the form of that used in B-Risk \cite{BranzFire}, adapted to be applicable to the calculational capabilities of the CFAST model.}.

\section{Fire Scenarios}
\label{Fire_Scenarios}

\subsection{Individual Variables}

The quantitative definition of fires is arguably the most important \cite{Babrauskas:1992} and complex of all the inputs in any fire modeling scenario. It includes specification of the fire location, fuel composition, ignition criterion, heat release rate, burning area, and species yields, most of which can vary with time over the course of the fire.

\section{Defining Data for Analysis}

Choosing modeling results for analysis depends on the goals of the hazard analysis and the particular technology under study. In the most general sense, this means understanding what results are indicative of improved fire safety. This is not a cost benefit analysis, which is a superset of this analysis and outside the scope of this project. To improve fire safety generally means reducing the deaths and injuries due to a fire. So, the goal is to identify which variables, that can be calculated, would give an indication that a new technology, in our case the new smoke alarm technology, will reduce deaths and injuries.

\chapter{CData User's Guide}
The CData program has several functions. One of them is as a PreProcessor used to create a set of data files that CFAST runs to generate data for an analysis. This chapter discusses how the PreProcessor works with some simple examples to demonstrate certain aspects of the system. First is an overview of the basic philosophy behind the PreProcessor. Section \ref{commands_section} discusses all the namelist commands that work in the PreProcessor. The final section discusses the significant issue of storage, which can limit on the size of the analysis that can be done.

\chapter{Nomenclature}
\label{nomenclature}

Note that the units associated with a given symbol are sometimes changed upon input to and output from the program. In particular, temperatures are typically input in degrees Celsius, converted to Kelvin, and then converted back to Celsius on output. Energy units involving Joules or Watts are typically input as kJ or kW, converted to J or W, then converted back to kJ or kW.
